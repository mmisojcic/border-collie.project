						In general, <b>Border Collies</b> are medium-sized
						dogs with a moderate amount of coat, which is most
						often thick and sheds often. They have a double coat
						that varies from smooth to rough and is occasionally
						curled. While black and white is the most commonly
						seen colour pattern of the Border Collie, the breed
						appears in just about any colour and pattern known
						to occur in dogs. Some of these include black
						tricolour (black/tan/white), liver and white, and
						red tricolour (red/tan/white) which have also been
						seen regularly, and other colours such as blue,
						lilac, red merle, blue merle, brindle, and
						Australian red (also known as ee red, blonde,
						recessive red, or gold) which is seen less
						frequently. Some Border Collies may also have
						single-colour coats
					</p>

					<p class="desc_text-part">
						Eye colour varies from brown to blue, and
						occasionally eyes of differing colour occur; this is
						usually seen with merles. The ears of the Border
						Collie are also variable — some have fully erect
						ears, some fully dropped ears, and others semi-erect
						ears (similar to those of the rough Collie).
						Although working Border Collie handlers sometimes
						have superstitions about the appearance of their
						dogs (handlers may avoid mostly white dogs due to
						the unfounded idea that sheep will not respect a
						white or almost all white dog), in general, the
						American Border Collie Association considers a dog's
						appearance to be irrelevant. Instead, it is
						considered more useful to identify a working Border
						Collie by its attitude and ability.
					</p>

					<p class="desc_text-part">
						Dogs bred for show are more homogeneous in
						appearance than working Border Collies, since to win
						in conformation showing they must conform closely to
						breed club standards that are specific on many
						points of the structure, coat, and colour. Kennel
						clubs specify, for example, that the Border Collie
						must have a "keen and intelligent" expression, and
						that the preferred eye colour is dark brown. In
						deference to the dog's working origin, scars and
						broken teeth received in the line of duty are not to
						be counted against a Border Collie in the show ring.
						The males' height from withers comes from 48 to 56
						centimetres (19 to 22 in), females from 46 to 53
						centimetres (18 to 21 in).
					</p>
					<h4 class="heading4">Temperament and needs</h4>
					<p class="desc_text-part">
						<b>Border Collies</b> require considerably more
						daily physical exercise and mental stimulation than
						many other breeds. The Border Collie is widely
						considered to be the most intelligent dog breed.
						Although the primary role of the Border Collie is to
						herd livestock, the breed is becoming increasingly
						popular as a companion animal.
					</p>
					<p class="desc_text-part">
						In this role, due to their working heritage, Border
						Collies are very demanding, playful, and energetic.
						They thrive best in households that can provide them
						with plenty of play and exercise, either with humans
						or other dogs. Due to their demanding personalities
						and need for mental stimulation and exercise, many
						Border Collies develop problematic behaviours in
						households that are not able to provide for their
						needs. They are infamous for chewing holes in walls
						and furniture, and destructive scraping and hole
						digging, due to boredom. Border Collies may exhibit
						a strong desire to herd, a trait they may show with
						small children, cats, and other dogs. The breed's
						herding trait has been deliberately encouraged, as
						it was in the dogs from which the Border Collie was
						developed, by selective breeding for many
						generations. However, being eminently trainable,
						they can live amicably with other pets if given
						proper socialisation training.
					</p>
					<p class="desc_text-part">
						The American Border Collie Association recommends
						that potential owners, before taking on the breed as
						a household pet, should be sure they can provide
						regular exercise commensurate with the collie's high
						energy and prodigious stamina. A working collie may
						run many miles a day, using its experience,
						personality and intelligence to control challenging
						livestock. These dogs will become distressed and
						frustrated if left in isolation, ignored or
						inactive. Like many working breeds, Border Collies
						can be motion-sensitive and may chase moving
						vehicles and bicycles, but this behaviour can be
						modified by training. Some of the more difficult
						behaviours require patience, as they are
						developmental and may disappear as the dog matures.

					<h4 class="heading4">The History</h4>
					<div class="info_history-text">
						<p class="info_history-text--part">
							The <b>Border Collie</b> is descended from
							landrace collies, a type found widely in the
							British Isles. The name for the breed came from
							its probable place of origin along the
							Anglo-Scottish border. Mention of the "Collie"
							or "Colley" type first appeared toward the end
							of the 19th century, although the word "collie"
							is older than this and has its origin in the
							Scots language. It is also thought that the word
							'collie' comes from the old Celtic word for
							useful. Many of the best Border Collies today
							can be traced back to a dog known as Old Hemp.
						</p>
						<p class="info_history-text--part">
							In 1915, James Reid, Secretary of the
							International Sheep Dog Society (ISDS) in the
							United Kingdom first used the term "Border
							Collie" to distinguish those dogs registered by
							the ISDS from the Kennel Club's Collie (or
							Scotch Collie, including the Rough Collie and
							Smooth Collie) which originally came from the
							same working stock but had developed a
							different, standardised appearance following
							introduction to the show ring in 1860 and
							mixture with different breeds.
						</p>
						<p class="info_history-text--part">
							<b>Old Hemp</b>, a tricolour dog, was born in
							Northumberland in September 1893 and died in May
							1901.[23] He was bred by Adam Telfer from Roy, a
							black and tan dog, and Meg, a black-coated,
							strong-eyed dog. Hemp was a quiet, powerful dog
							to which sheep responded easily. Many shepherds
							used him for stud and Hemp's working style
							became the Border Collie style. All pure Border
							Collies alive today can trace an ancestral line
							back to Old Hemp. He was believed to have sired
							as many as 200 pups over the span of his life.
						</p>
						<p class="info_history-text--part">
							<b>Wiston Cap</b> (b. 28 September 1963)[26] is
							the dog that the International Sheep Dog Society
							(ISDS) badge portrays in the characteristic
							Border Collie herding pose. He was a popular
							stud dog in the history of the breed, and his
							bloodline can be seen in most bloodlines of the
							modern day Collie. Bred by W. S. Hetherington
							and trained and handled by John Richardson, Cap
							was a biddable and good-natured dog. His
							bloodlines all trace back to the early
							registered dogs of the stud book, and to J. M.
							Wilson's Cap, whose name occurs 16 times within
							seven generations in his pedigree. Wiston Cap
							sired three Supreme Champions and is grand-sire
							of three others, one of whom was E. W. Edwards'
							Bill, who won the championship twice.
